# Cloud-computing-project-Detect-Celebrity

## Introduction

In this project, a flask web application is created and deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Following instructions on the home page, user can upload photos to the web page where celebrity faces will be detected. After clicking the recognition bottom, users can obtain the name and information page of the celebrity presented in the photo.

The application was build and tested through AWS CodePipeline for continous delivery and continuous integration on the cloud.
